# Knowledge-based-guitar-suggesting-system
As a demonstration I have developed a knowledge base guitar suggesting system according to customers budget, which can be used in a musical instrument shop. This idea can be used in further business sectors and can be developed as a smart shop system. This is a demonstration for using expert system in business fields.
